        <h2 class="mt-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">I would love to get involved, but I don't know where to begin.</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">Need some assistance? Need inspiration? Whatever you need, we are here to help! Sign up below and we will assist you in writing the perfect messages, to help designing your fundraising page, to being available for any questions you might have throughout your campaign, and finally celebrating with you when you meet your goal!</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">I have my fundraising page finished and my messages ready. Now what?</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">Great! Now the fun begins! Be the first donor. Make a great comment! It shows that you are all in. Start posting on your social network (Facebook, Instagram, etc.). Send emails and texts. As people start to give, you will see their donations on your fundraising page. It is very important to respond with a thank you message. We will also send a thank you message to your donors as well.</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">I want to make a bigger impact. How can I do this?</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">Add a challenge to all of your messages and to your fundraising page. This is a great way to get others involved. See below why and how a challenge works.</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">Why a challenge?</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">It is critical that as much of the funds that Transform Through WE receives go directly to the effort. Having passionate, excited supporters sharing with their social network greatly reduces the expenses that Transform Through WE needs to spend to get the word out. The more challenges that are initiated and completed, the more Life Transformation Systems will be installed. The bottom line, more lives will be transformed!</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">"15 For 15" Challenge</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">A simple and easy, yet very powerful way for you to fundraise. The challenge is in two parts. The first is for you to give a one-time donation of $15. Simple and easy. The second is for you to share about our effort through your social network (friends, family, coworkers, etc.) and challenge them to do the same as you have done, which is to give a one-time donation of $15 and share it with their social network. That is the powerful part! That is it! When people accept the challenge, we will follow up with them and keep the excitement going! Simple... Easy... Powerful...</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">Why only A $15 one-time donation?</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">There are a number of reasons. First, we wanted to make the amount to give an easy decision. Second, with respect to those who choose to help fundraise, we wanted to make the challenge amount easy as well. Third, we don't want to take away any funds from other nonprofits you, and those that you contact, support.</p>
          <h4 class="text-primary">I am a college student. What is the best way to promote AI Lucky Foundation on campus?</h4>
          <p class="ms-5">First you need to check with your school to make sure that it is ok to raise money on campus. If it is ok, be sure to know the rules and steps to follow. Then start with setting up your fundraising page and get your messages ready. Now is the fun part. You have a number of ways to promote your fundraising challenge on campus. Be as creative as you want. Start a "15 For 15" Challenge and reach out to the students you know. Challenge them to get the word out. Challenge your fraternity or sorority if you are in one. Take the challenge to the next level and challenge other fraternities and sororities. In no time you can be reaching the whole student body and providing a Life Transformation System to a village that desperately needs to be lifted out of poverty.</p>

      <div style="background-color: #BFD7ED;max-width: 80%;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="my-5 mx-auto p-4 shadow border-0 rounded-4">
        <p class="fs-5">Lastly, we want to show just how much of an impact a small one-time donation can make. Combined with organic fundraising starting with your social network, to the untold numbers of people that will be touched by your friends, family, and coworkers, and beyond to give is powerful. From the beginning of the project to the onsite installation, everyone's efforts will be realized through a video documentary seeing the lives of people transformed!</p>
